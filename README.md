 Ani-Zone is a fun app that has users take a quiz to determine which shows they are likely to enjoy! Its a simple concept, but meant to be a fun way to get people in to the world of anime!

 In the app, users can:
 -Make an account
 -Take a short quiz
 -Have a list of shows pop up on their screen with descriptions and where they can watch them
 -Share their results with others
 -Have discussions/leave reviews on their favorite....or least favorite shows!
